<p>Implemented a MATLAB code which would be taking beam parameters, location and magnitude of the Force / Moment / Uniform Distributed Load, and plot the bending (i.e. final configuration) of the beam using the double integration method. In many cases of structural and machine designs, members must resist the force applied laterally or transversely to their axes. Such members are called beam. The main members supporting floors of buildings are beams, just as an axle of a car is a beam. Beam deflection means the state of deformation of a beam from its original shape under the work of a force or load or weight. One of the most important applications of beam deflection is to obtain equations with which we can determine the accurate values of beam deflections in many practical cases. Deflections are also used in the analysis of statically indeterminate beams. Beam deflections due to bending are determined from deformation taking place along a span. This is based on the hypothesis that during bending, plane sections through a beam remains plain. For now, it will be assumed that bending takes place only about one of the principal axes of the cross-section. The edge view of the neutral surface of a deflected beam is called the elastic curve of the beam.
Finally, to make this user friendly, used MATLAB app designer to create user interface and converted code to app.</p>

      <p>The problem statement was to Build a manually controlled robot capable of competing in a one on one game of soccer.
        The main goal of a participating bot is to shoot the ball into the opponents goal post.
  The Ball is to be taken across the field only by pushing. It cannot be clamped or lifted in the air.
  At no point of time should the ball be covered by all sides by the participant’s bot or any part of it.
  The robots may not hold the ball while moving. Dribbler mechanisms can be used; however the ball must have at least one direction for free motion.
  Shooting is allowed with any appropriate mechanism.
  The robots can use the side wall for reflecting the ball. It won’t be considered as a foul.
  A participant’s bot is not supposed to interact directly with the opponent’s bot when it is not in possession of the ball. If one of the bot is in possession of the ball, the other can attempt to dispossess it by attacking only the ball.
  Physical interaction between the bots in this process will be tolerated if it is judged that the attacking bot went for the ball.
  If a bot is found to commit a foul (directly hitting/obstructing motion of opponent’s bot), the opponent will be given a free–shot.
  In case of entangling of the wires there can be a restart , with the ball placed at the point where it was before the entangling of the wires, upon the discretion of the referee.
  Damaging the arena in any form will lead to immediate disqualification.
  After every goal being scored the ball would be placed back in the center circle and each bot shall restart from their respective D-lines
  Even own goals are counted.
  As soon as the time elapses the time-limit of 5 minutes a match is over and the bot having maximum number of goals wins.</p>

      <p>Designed a 3D working model of a single girder overhead crane on SolidWorks. Implemented changes over the conventional rope and pulley overhead crane. Performed motion, force and stress analysis using SolidWorks Simulation and Measurements. To move extremely heavy or bulky loads through the overhead space in a facility, an overhead crane, also called an bridge crane is a machine that lift, lowers and moves a load. An overhead crane consists of parallel runways with a traveling bridge spanning the gap. A hoist, the lifting component of a crane, travels along the bridge. Since there are 3 degrees of freedom for the overhead crane, three different types of motions can be executed independently. The major difference between our design and the industrial design is that we have used the inverted scissor lift over the rope and pulley system. Speed, Strength and Ease were the 3 distinguishing factors of our crane which made it better than traditional crane.</p>

      <p>As part of a startup competetion, held by techniche IIT Guwahati, we were required to design a startup idea which would help to reduce unemployment and help the poor people as well. Our idea was that every person is educated enough to pass on his skills to another person. Not only educational qualification, it could be any skill like dancing, singing, drawing etc. The idea is that each person would get a chance of one on one learning and that too for negligible rates. Plus you can teach others and earn money that you can inturn use for self education. We bagged 3rd position in the competetiona nd our idea was appreciated.</p>

      <p>Simon Says (or Simple Simon Says) is a children's game for three or more players. One player takes the role of "Simon" and issues instructions (usually physical actions such as "jump in the air" or "stick out your tongue") to the other players, which should be followed only when prefaced with the phrase "Simon says". Players are eliminated from the game by either following instructions that are not immediately preceded by the phrase, or by failing to follow an instruction which does include the phrase "Simon says". It is the ability to distinguish between genuine and fake commands, rather than physical ability, that usually matters in the game; in most cases, the action just needs to be attempted. In many regions of the United States, “Simon Says” is also known as "Simon Sez". The object for the player acting as Simon is to get all the other players out as quickly as possible; the winner of the game is usually the last player who has successfully followed all of the given commands. Occasionally, however, two or more of the last players may all be eliminated at the same time, thus resulting in Simon winning the game.
      </p><p>I created a web version of the same game and used sound and graphics to make the game more appealing and eye catching.</p>
